/**
 * Use the built-in post counter
 *
 * Sometimes you'll want to keep track of which post you're on in a loop.
 * Some people create their own \$loop_counter (ex: Genesis, https://gist.github.com/4675237 ).
 * There's a better way! A loop counter is built into \$wp_query. Ex:
 *
 * global \$wp_query;
 * echo \$wp_query->current_post
 *
 * Count starts at 0 (first post is 0, second post is 1 )
